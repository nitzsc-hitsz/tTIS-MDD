# tTIS-MDD
This study investigated the intervention effects of tTIS in treating MDD. 

Following an acute tTIS intervention protocol of 20 minutes per session over five consecutive days, 61.3% of the 31 enrolled patients exhibited a treatment response immediately after the intervention, and 44.4% continued to meet the response criteria four weeks later. The specific interventional outcomes of tTIS were further analyzed from the perspectives of static functional connectivity and dynamic high-amplitude co-fluctuations.

The Jupyter notebook files in this repository contain the code of intervention effect analysis of tTIS for MDD.
